# Machine-Learning-In-Relativistic-Astrophysics

This repo shows the typical example of using Machine Learning in Astrophysics. The base code was part of the subsidiary data science workshop of ICRANET-ISFAHAN conference held ONLINE on Nov. 2021. The base code is modified in order to find the answer to the following questions: 
1. Is there any difference in the accuracy of the decision trees between quasi-stellar objects (QSO) and regular Galaxies ? 
2. What will be the best fraction of split and test data?
